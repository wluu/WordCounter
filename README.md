# WordCounter
A fun simple project to data mine text from TV episodes and movies.

So far, I've processed:
* South Park's "It Hits the Fan"
	* And I'm still off (guess which word that is :laughing:)
* The Iron Giant
	* Good movie

# Technical Bit
This project uses node.js to generate an HTML output which uses https://developers.google.com/chart/ to generate the bar charts.

To generate the HTML output, run `node main.js southpark` or `node main.js irongiant`
