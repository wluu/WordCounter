# WordCounter
A fun simple project to data mine text from TV episodes and movies.

So far, I've only processed South Park's "It Hits the Fan" and I'm still off (guess which word that is :laughing:).

# Technical Bit
This project uses node.js to generate an HTML output which uses https://developers.google.com/chart/ to generate the bar chart. Currently, the generated HTML is still catered towards "It Hits the Fan".

To generate the HTML output, run `node main.js`
